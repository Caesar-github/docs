# RKNNToolkit2 OPs Support

## Explanation of terms:

**Remarks**:

    Operators' specifications must meet the remarks' requirements.

**Broadcast rule**: 

- per-layerï¼š 

        shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar ==> shape(result) = (2, 3, 4, 5)

- per-channel: 
      
        shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3,), ==> shape(result) = (2, 3, 4, 5)
        
        shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (1,3,1,1), ==> shape(result) = (2, 3, 4, 5)
    
- per-element: 

        shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2,3,4,5) ==> shape(result) = (2, 3, 4, 5)

- other:

        shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,) ==> shape(result) = (2, 3, 4, 5)

**Input Size Restrictions Description**


Assuming that input size is [N,H,W,C] (layout is NHWC)

- Case 1: the first layer is **Convolution**, whose kernel size is [kernel_height, kernel_width]

  **W * kernel_height < 7168**

  **kernel_height * kernel_width < 128**


- Case 2: first layer is not Convolution, and C == 1 or C == 3 or C == 4

  **W < 7168**

- others:
  
  **No Restrictions**

## Caffe OPs supported by RKNN Toolkit2

Caffe protocols RKNN Toolkit2 uses only based on the officially modified protocol of berkeley.
The protocol based on the official revision of berkeley comes from [berkeley caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/src/caffe/proto 'Berkeley Caffe'), commit hash is 21d0608. On this basis RKNN Toolkit2 have added some OPs.  
Based on this protocol, the list of Caffe OPs supported by RKNN Toolkit2 is as follows:
